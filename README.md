### Explore US BikeShare Data
### Description
In the Explore US Bikeshare Data project, I have used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

Some questions that the program will be answering in this project are:

What is the most common month?
What is the most common day of week?
What is the most common hour of day?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most common start station and most common end station?
What is the most common trip from start to end?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)?
What is the earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)?

### Files used
bikeshare_2.py,
data (.csv) files

### Credits
I'd like to thank my mentor from Udacity, who reviewed my code and guided me to make necessary changes to it, and complete it as a part of my nanodegree.
